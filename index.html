  <h1>Too Quiet</h1>

  <h2>Too quiet is a game about intrusive thoughts.Intrusive thoughts are unwanted thoughts that pop into our heads without any warning. They can become very distressing if they are not controlled or dispelled. In this game, players will start by
    popping all the negative thought bubbles. Afterwards they will be taken to a bonus round where they will collect as many positive thought bubbles as possible. </h2>
